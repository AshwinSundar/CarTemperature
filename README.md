# Car Temperature

I collected and plotted the interior temperature of my car during a particular hot spell in mid June here in Phoenix. Here's what I got: https://imgur.com/a/1jrUH

Hardware components: 
* Particle Photon
* 2 NTC thermistors (Amphenol MA100BF103A - probably overkill, but it's what I had on hand)
* 3 C batteries (the heat really saps the batteries)

Software components: 
* Particle command line interface
* MATLAB
* Excel
