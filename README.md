# Car Temperature

I collected and plotted the interior temperature of my car during a particular hot spell in mid June here in Phoenix.

Tools used: 
* Particle Photon
* 2 NTC thermistors (Amphenol MA100BF103A)
* 3 C batteries (the heat really saps the batteries)
* Particle command line interface
* MATLAB
* Excel
